__Resumen:__ <br />
The growing development of machine learning techniques has aroused great interest due to its potential to contribute to the production of environmental knowledge useful for informed decision-making in public environmental management at the local level. In this sense, the project aims to generate, through the application of such techniques and from an interdisciplinary perspective, conceptual, methodological and technical tools to collect, interpret and extract environmental information for its publication in the Integrated Environmental Information System of Luján.  <br />
To this end, from a complex thinking approach, the project proposes a first exploratory stage aimed at strengthening the disciplinary integration of concepts, to later advance in a theoretical and experimental balance, where the critical analysis of sources (documentary research technique) of environmental information on the area of study and modeling is complemented by the development of empirical tests, with the development of empirical tests of software, algorithms and methods, in order to build a knowledge base that allows the implementation of the results in concrete applications such as the Integrated Environmental Information System of Luján (SIAI-Luján), system developed in the extension project 2019-2022, whose continuity is in the process of evaluation of the call 2023 at the National University of Luján.  <br />
Although the research applies to the specific case of the municipality of Luján (Province of Buenos Aires), it is expected, based on the experimental approach, to develop a general process for this type of environmental information extraction projects and the production of knowledge from textual data in general.
